# Intro_TSA_TrendLine_Estimation

### Short Description:
TSA or Time Series Analysis is an integral part of Data Science and Statistics. Using this became a must as it helps in analyzing trend/pattern in a data over a period of time. This time variable may be monthly, hourly, quarterly or it can be yearly. In this project we will see how to analyze the trend/pattern hidden in a data set. We will also see how to fit a trend line (Linear and Quadratic) in a data using two approaches. All of this works will be done by using R programming.
